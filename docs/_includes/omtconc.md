A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below:

  * In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse.
  * Press **Ctrl+F** on your keyboard.
  * The Search window will open.
  * Press Search. 
  * The results will be displayed.
  * You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place.

**TIP:** There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an *exact match*. The option "Keyword search" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting.
