When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. 
You will see the suggested target term in the **Glossary pane**, on the right.

OmegaT has **predictive typing**: when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press **Enter** on your keyboard.
