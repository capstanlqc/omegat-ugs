If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in **red font**.

There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags:

  * **Standalone tags** = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. <br/> tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML)
  * **Double tags** are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. **Double tags** affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation.
