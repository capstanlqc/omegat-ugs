The software has been customized to enable you to perform your task. Quick walkthrough \u00b6 Download the package for adaptation and the Excel document from the portal Import the OMT package in OmegaT as described in the section The OmegaT project for adaptation will open: If you're borrowing another translation, all segments will probably appear translated in the Editor pane (the main pane of OmegaT, which contains the source text and the translation). If you are adapting from a base version (your target version is a variation of the source version), you might find it useful to automatically insert the source text in every segment . You can distinguish trend segments from non-trend segments thanks to a color coding: trend segments appear highlighted in orange. For more information about navigation between segments, please refer to the section of this user guide. If you adapt any recurring term or recurring instructions in a file, please make sure that the adaptation is done consistently. You can perform a concordance search on a specific term or phrase and OmegaT will display all segments containing it. You can go through the results to make sure that everything has been adapted consistently. For more information about concordance searches, please check the section Concordance search Installation and setup \u00b6 To install OmegaT on a computer running on Windows, please consult the . Accessing the package \u00b6 Accessing the package for the first time \u00b6 The following steps need to be performed only once per OmegaT package : when you access each package for the first time: Download the from the portal Store the in a location you will remember on your computer. Import the in OmegaT: Open OmegaT Go to Project>Import OMT package Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Choose the and click on Open A pop up opens. Click Yes . Translate/Reconcile/Adapt/Review the files in the package. When you are done working for the day, close OmegaT. Access the package after import \u00b6 The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project>Open Recent Project . The project you were working on is the first one in the list: Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between the different segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. When a translation is inserted, it will appear below the source text. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). If you want to make a change to a trend segment, document it in the monitoring document but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. All segments should appear translated in a project for adaptation either in gray or in orange (trend) and the translation should be displayed below the source. If you notice an untranslated segment in ****, please provide a translation and document it in the monitoring document. Handling tags (Ctrl+T) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the * are around the letter *\"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl+T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Most common HTML tags \u00b6 Below you will find the most common HTML tags you may encounter. Using Fuzzy matches (Ctrl+I) \u00b6 Any changes you make during adaptation are saved in the project's translation memory. When you activate a segment which is similar to one you have already adapted, you may see suggestions in the fuzzy matches pane. The source in the fuzzy matches pane shows the difference between the active segment and the previous translation in \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode like in Word: Parts that do not appear in the active segment are in ~~~~ Parts that are added are in ____ Do not hesitate to consult the fuzzy matches pane to ensure you make the same changes consistently throughout. You can insert a fuzzy match or a part of a fuzzy match with Ctrl+I : Activate the fuzzy match you wish to use by double clicking on it. With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert. Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard to insert it. Do not forget to delete all unnecessary/remaining text from the target segment to ensure everything is correct. Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If in the project you are working on you keep adapting the same term over and over you may wish to add it to the glossary to ensure you adapt consistently throughout. In the active segment, select the term you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Glossary adherence check \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK. An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the eventual error if needed. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom. This is the file you have to deliver. Shortcuts cheatsheet \u00b6 Here is a table summarizing all functions you need to remember to work in OmegaT. Shortcuts (keyboard combinations) are provided if they are frequently used.

Do we have access to the translation memories from the previous cycle if we already took part in the project? \u00b6 The answer is yes. You can access it in two different ways: from OmegaT: the translation memory per domain from the previous cycle is included as reference in the OmegaT packages. from which contains translations from all previous cycles of the project for your language. Is it possible to access MemoryLn with a translator account? \u00b6 The answer is yes. MemoryLn can be accessed by logging in to the portal. If you have portal credentials you can access MemoryLn for your language by default, independently of the role you have in the project. Can I export the XLIFFs and work in Trados or another CAT tool? \u00b6 The answer is no. OmegaT was specifically customized to edit the files you are working on. Such a customization is not possible in Trados or memoQ. Removing the files from the OMT package and translating them separately may damage the files and render them unusable on the portal. In omegaT is it possible to search for translation by the target? Or it\u2019s only possible by source? \u00b6 The answer is yes.

When I reconcile I only see suggestions from translator 1 for certain segments. Is it normal? \u00b6 The answer is yes. When you only see 1 suggestion in the fuzzy matches pane, it means the two translators have proposed the exact same translation. Next to the fuzzy match from translator 1 you will also notice it is written +1 more. Why is my OMT package rejected in the portal and how I can fix it? \u00b6 It is required that all segments are translated at the end of both translation and reconciliation tasks.

The software has been customized to enable you to perform your task. Quick walkthrough for proofreading \u00b6 Download the OMT package and the Excel file containing the translation and adaptation guidelines from Plunet. Import the OMT package in OmegaT. To see how to do so, please read the section Accessing the package for the first time . Create the target files for preview on the portal. To see how to create the files, please refer to the section Creating target files Connect to the PISA portal with the credentials provided in the dispatch mail: PISA PORTAL Go to the Translations TAB Drag and drop the target XLIFF you wish to preview and press the Preview chosen XLIFF Button The XLIFF for preview in your language opens. You can also preview the source text by clicking on Preview eng-ZZZ button Read the items in your language on the portal. Focus on the following: Fluency Grammar & Typos Punctuation To navigate from one screen to the other and read through the full item press the \"Next\" arrows on the screen If you notice something you wish to correct, copy the sentence/part of the sentence in your language from the preview In OmegaT, press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The search dialog opens. Paste the sentence/part of sentence you copied from the portal and press the Search button. Double click on the result to go to the appropriate segment in OmegaT. In the screenshot below, the segment number is 40 Before you make any changes, double check in the Excel file if there is no guideline for that segment, or if there is no comment from the reconciler. The changes you make cannot contradict a guideline or the reconciler's decision. If you are in a case where you believe something should be changed and it goes against the guidelines, please send us an e-mail to explain the situation. Repeat this process for all files in your batch. When you are done, create the target OMT package for delivery Delivering the project and upload it on Plunet together with the Excel for documentation. Accessing the package \u00b6 Accessing the package for the first time \u00b6 The following steps need to be performed only once per OmegaT package : when you access each package for the first time: Download the from the portal Store the in a location you will remember on your computer. Import the in OmegaT: Open OmegaT Go to Project>Import OMT package Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Choose the and click on Open A pop up opens. Click Yes . Translate/Reconcile/Adapt/Review the files in the package. When you are done working for the day, close OmegaT. Access the package after import \u00b6 The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project>Open Recent Project . The project you were working on is the first one in the list: Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between the different segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. The translation is displayed right below the source text. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). These segments cannot be edited in OmegaT. All segments should appear translated in a project for proofreading. If you notice an untranslated segment in ****, please contact cApStAn's project managers to see how it should be handled. Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the * are around the letter *\"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl+T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom. This is the file you have to deliver. Shortcuts cheatsheet \u00b6 Here is a table summarizing all functions you need to remember to work in OmegaT.

More details about how to create the package for delivery can be found in the section Exporting the package for delivery Installation and setup \u00b6 To install OmegaT on a computer running on Windows, please consult the . Accessing the package \u00b6 Accessing the package for the first time \u00b6 The following steps need to be performed only once per OmegaT package : when you access each package for the first time: Download the from the portal Store the in a location you will remember on your computer. Import the in OmegaT: Open OmegaT Go to Project>Import OMT package Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Choose the and click on Open A pop up opens. Click Yes . Translate/Reconcile/Adapt/Review the files in the package. When you are done working for the day, close OmegaT. Access the package after import \u00b6 The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project>Open Recent Project . The project you were working on is the first one in the list: Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear below the source text . Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use Ctrl+U to jump to the next untranslated segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Blue = untranslated segment Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). If you want to make a change to a trend segment, document it in the Excel Sheet but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. Reconciling using Fuzzy matches (Ctrl+I) \u00b6 For reconciliation, the translations from translator 1 and translator 2 are handled as fuzzy matches and are displayed in the Fuzzy matches pane . A reconciler's task in practice consists of: inserting in full the suggestion from translator 1 or translator 2 OR inserting a part of the suggestion from translator 1 and completing with part of the translator 2 OR translating the segment from scratch if no suggestions are satisfactory By default, the suggestion from translator 1 is selected. It is the first one in the list and it is displayed in bold . If you want to use the suggestion from translator 2 you need to activate it by double click it on it. The second fuzzy match (suggestion from translator 2) becomes bold. To insert the fuzzy match in full, press Ctrl+I on your keyboard. After inserting it, do not forget to make the necessary changes so that it fits the segment you are reconciling. Alternatively, you can also insert only a part of the fuzzy match or combine several matches: Activate the match you want use With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard to insert it Select another fuzzy match if appropriate or finish translating the segment Please remember that it is important to make sure the final translation is harmonized as the two translators may use different terms and styles. To ensure this, make sure you preview the item prior to delivery and perform concordance searches on recurring instructions and terminology. Handling tags (Ctrl+T) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the * are around the letter *\"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl+T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If in the project you are working on you keep adapting the same term over and over you may wish to add it to the glossary to ensure you adapt consistently throughout. In the active segment, select the term you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Glossary adherence check \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK. An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the potential error if needed. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom.

The software has been customized to enable you to perform your task. Installation and setup \u00b6 To install OmegaT on a computer running on Windows, please consult the . Accessing the package \u00b6 Accessing the package for the first time \u00b6 The following steps need to be performed only once per OmegaT package : when you access each package for the first time: Download the from the portal Store the in a location you will remember on your computer. Import the in OmegaT: Open OmegaT Go to Project>Import OMT package Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Choose the and click on Open A pop up opens. Click Yes . Translate/Reconcile/Adapt/Review the files in the package. When you are done working for the day, close OmegaT. Access the package after import \u00b6 The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project>Open Recent Project . The project you were working on is the first one in the list: Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear below the source text . Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use Ctrl+U to jump to the next untranslated segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Blue = untranslated segment Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). If you want to make a change to a trend segment, document it in the Excel Sheet but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. Handling tags (Ctrl+T) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Inserting tags \u00b6 To insert tags in your translation, you should use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T , which inserts the next missing tag. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. If you need to insert tags in a different order than in the source, we advise you to translate the entire segment, place your cursor where the first tag has to be inserted and press Ctrl+T, then repeat the operation until all tags have been inserted. If you have inserted a tag incorrectly and need to delete it, select the tag in full (you can double click on it) and press backspace or delete on your keyboard. Most common HTML tags \u00b6 Below you will find the most common HTML tags you may encounter. Using Fuzzy matches (Ctrl+I) \u00b6 When you translate, your translations are saved in the project\u2019s translation memory. When you activate a segment which is similar to one you have already translated, you will see suggestions appearing in the fuzzy matches pane. The source in the fuzzy matches pane shows the difference between the active segment and the previous translation in \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode like in Word: Parts that do not appear in the active segment are in ~~~~ Parts that are added are in ____ When there are several fuzzy matches for a segment, they are sorted by similarity to the new segment. The active fuzzy match is the one in bold . By default, it will be the first one in the list. If you want to use a different fuzzy match, double click on it to activate it. To insert the fuzzy match in full, press Ctrl+I on your keyboard. After inserting it, do not forget to make the necessary changes so that it fits the segment you are translating. Alternatively, you can also insert only a part of the fuzzy match or combine several matches: Activate the match you want use With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard to insert it Select another fuzzy match if appropriate or finish translating the segment Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If the project you are working on contains technical terms or you notice certain terms keep repeating, you can add them to the glossary. To add a term: In the active segment, select the term you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Inserting source segment in target \u00b6 In some cases, the translation and the source segment must be identical. To insert the source text in the target segment, press Ctrl+Shift+S on your keyboard. You can also copy & paste the source text into the target. Leaving a segment empty \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. If you leave a segment empty, the source text will be displayed in the final document. If you wish the segment to remain empty, insert a space in the target segment instead of the actual translation. Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches (Ctrl+F) \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Check glossary adherence \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK. An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the potential error if needed. TIP : Not all flagged issues are errors by default. In some cases, you may get false positives. In the screenshot below, \"apple trees\" should be translated as \"pommiers\" as in the first segment. In the second segment (active segment) \"apple trees\" was rendered as \"ces arbres\" (backtranslation: these trees) to avoid a repetition that would be disturbing in French. Such deviations from the glossary are intentional. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom. This is the file you have to deliver. Shortcuts cheatsheet \u00b6 Here is a table summarizing all functions you need to remember to work in OmegaT.

Once the options are set, click on Tagwipe to run it. The OmegaT project will close and reopen with your cleaned Word document. Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between the different segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. The translation is displayed right below the source text. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). These segments cannot be edited in OmegaT. If you need to implement changes in a trend segment, a separate user guide will explain how to modify them using a different tool. Pink = pretranslated but unlocked All segments should appear translated in a project for adaptation either in gray or in orange (trend) or in pink (pretranslated). If you notice an untranslated segment in ****, please contact cApStAn's project managers to see how it should be handled. Handling tags (Ctrl+T) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the * are around the letter *\"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl+T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Using Fuzzy matches (Ctrl+I) \u00b6 Any changes you make during adaptation are saved in the project's translation memory. When you activate a segment which is similar to one you have already adapted, you may see suggestions in the fuzzy matches pane. The source in the fuzzy matches pane shows the difference between the active segment and the previous translation in \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode like in Word: Parts that do not appear in the active segment are in ~~~~ Parts that are added are in ____ Do not hesitate to consult the fuzzy matches pane to ensure you make the same changes consistently throughout. You can insert a fuzzy match or a part of a fuzzy match with Ctrl+I : Activate the fuzzy match you wish to use by double clicking on it. With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert. Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard to insert it. Do not forget to delete all unnecessary/remaining text from the target segment to ensure everything is correct. Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If in the project you are working on you keep adapting the same term over and over you may wish to add it to the glossary to ensure you adapt consistently throughout. In the active segment, select the term you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Glossary adherence check \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK. An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the eventual error if needed. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Preview in Microsoft Word \u00b6 When translating coding guides, you cannot preview them on the PISA portal and have to use Microsoft Word to see how they will look like. To find the translated Word document, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on and open it with Word. Go through the Word document to check for any potential issues, but if you find one make your changes in OmegaT and not in the Word document itself. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom. This is the file you have to deliver. Shortcuts cheatsheet \u00b6 Here is a table summarizing all functions you need to remember to work in OmegaT.

The translation is displayed right below the source text. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). These segments cannot be edited in OmegaT. If you need to implement changes in a trend segment, a separate user guide will explain how to modify them using a different tool. Pink = pretranslated but unlocked All segments should appear translated in a project for verification either in gray or in orange (trend) or in pink (pretranslated). If you notice an untranslated segment in ****, please contact cApStAn's project managers to see how it should be handled. Handling tags (Ctrl+T) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the * are around the letter *\"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl+T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Most common HTML tags \u00b6 Below you will find the most common HTML tags you may encounter. Using Fuzzy matches (Ctrl+I) \u00b6 Any changes you make during adaptation are saved in the project's translation memory. When you activate a segment which is similar to one you have already adapted, you may see suggestions in the fuzzy matches pane. The source in the fuzzy matches pane shows the difference between the active segment and the previous translation in \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode like in Word: Parts that do not appear in the active segment are in ~~~~ Parts that are added are in ____ Do not hesitate to consult the fuzzy matches pane to ensure you make the same changes consistently throughout. You can insert a fuzzy match or a part of a fuzzy match with Ctrl+I : Activate the fuzzy match you wish to use by double clicking on it. With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert. Press Ctrl+I on your keyboard to insert it. Do not forget to delete all unnecessary/remaining text from the target segment to ensure everything is correct. Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If in the project you are working on you keep adapting the same term over and over you may wish to add it to the glossary to ensure you adapt consistently throughout. In the active segment, select the term you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl+S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl+Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl+U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl+T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. CAUTION : Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Glossary adherence check \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK. An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the eventual error if needed. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl+Shift+D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the . Go to Project>Export OMT Package A pop up window will open. Click Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. You will be automatically directed to the location the exported package is stored. You will recognize the package because it has the extension OMT. It should be the 4th from the bottom. This is the file you have to deliver. Shortcuts cheatsheet \u00b6 Here is a table summarizing all functions you need to remember to work in OmegaT.

That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments. Everything that follows applies to source segments too, with the difference that they are not directly editable in the translation editor in OmegaT. Bidirectionality mode \u00b6 The bidirectionality mode activates either when at least one of the two languages in the project uses a RTL script or when some text in a RTL is inserted. When the bidirectionality mode is activated, text direction is indicated by a flag on the top of the cursor. In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one. That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment. Strong and weak directionality \u00b6 In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment. Orientation \u00b6 Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted. Bidirectionality control characters \u00b6 Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters . Marks \u00b6 Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings. Embeddings \u00b6 The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks. For starters, two characters must be inserted: one to start the embedding and another one to pop out of it. For example, to create a LTR embedding in an RTL segment, you would insert a left-to-right embedding (LRE) character, then the LTR text, then the pop directional formatting (PDF) character. Likewise, to create a RTL embedding in an LTR segment, you would insert a right-to-left embedding (RLE) character, then the RTL text, then the PDF character. Let\u2019s see an example. Equations, formulas and mathematical notation in general are expressions that must normally run left-to-right in bidirectional languages like Arabic or Hebrew, just like in English. Simply typing or copy-pasting an equation in Arabic will not produce the correct result, as can be seen in the image below: Instead, you should proceed in this way to create a LTR embedding: insert the LRE character, then type or insert the equation, finally insert the PDF character. See that in action: Notice how the red square rim appears around the LTR embedding right after inserting the PDF character, when the option Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters is activated in the View menu.","title":"Handling bidirectionality in OmegaT"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#handling_bidirectionality","text":"","title":"Handling bidirectionality"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#text_direction_and_text_alignment","text":"By default, text direction in the translation editor is left to right (LTR) and text is aligned to the left. That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments. Everything that follows applies to source segments too, with the difference that they are not directly editable in the translation editor in OmegaT.","title":"Text direction and text alignment"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#bidirectionality_mode","text":"The bidirectionality mode activates either when at least one of the two languages in the project uses a RTL script or when some text in a RTL is inserted. When the bidirectionality mode is activated, text direction is indicated by a flag on the top of the cursor. In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one. That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment.","title":"Bidirectionality mode"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#strong_and_weak_directionality","text":"In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment.","title":"Strong and weak directionality"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#orientation","text":"Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted.","title":"Orientation"},{"location":"tec-omt-rtl/#bidirectionality_control_characters","text":"Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment.
